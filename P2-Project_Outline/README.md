## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project idea will be a web application with the potential to be adapted to a mobile app. The web app will help people with disabilites with traveling arrangments. Letting the user know ahead how accessible is the location they plan on visiting. I got the idea while traveling to different cities and establishments myself. Sometimes I don't know if a business I'm visiting even have a ramp outside. And knowing other people with disabilites, I wanted to know if there was a better way to travel to make the world a more accessible place. 
### Features
1. A search bar that you can enter an address or business name and the results will show the user if the establishment is accessible or not according to ADA law.
2. A Events Menu that will let you know what events in your area are special needs friendly. And if you want to attent that event helps you put it on your  or a calender.
3. A full accessible friendly website.
